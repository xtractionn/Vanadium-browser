## Installation

Vanadium is an open-source browser designed for the popular custom ROM GrapheneOS. This browser is installed by default in GrapheneOS and is one of the most secure browsers available today. Unfortunately, GrapheneOS does not provide the APK or any other source for the browser.

To address this, I have built Venedium using the source code from GrapheneOS. You can now install it on your device and use it as a secure alternative to browsers like Chrome or any other browser.

#### HOW TO INSTALL
first install library.apk then 
install WebView.apk then 
install vanadium.apk
